# PWA Install Button Not Working - Troubleshooting Guide

## Why the Install Button Might Not Work

### 1. **PWA Installation Requirements**

For the install prompt to appear, ALL of these must be met:

- ✅ **HTTPS** - Site must use HTTPS (localhost is exempt)
- ✅ **Manifest** - Valid manifest.json file
- ✅ **Service Worker** - Registered and active
- ✅ **Icons** - At least 192x192 and 512x512 icons
- ✅ **Not Already Installed** - App not already installed
- ✅ **User Engagement** - User has interacted with the site (some browsers)

### 2. **Check Browser Compatibility**

Different browsers have different requirements:

#### Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Mobile)
- ✅ Best PWA support
- Shows install button automatically when criteria met
- `beforeinstallprompt` event fires

#### Firefox
- Limited PWA support on desktop
- Mobile support varies
- May not show install prompt

#### Safari (iOS/Mac)
- ❌ Does NOT support `beforeinstallprompt` event
- ❌ No automatic install button
- ⚠️ Manual: Share button → "Add to Home Screen"

## Current Implementation

The install button now provides browser-specific instructions when the automatic prompt isn't available.

### What Happens When You Click:

1. **If install prompt available:** Shows native install dialog
2. **If already installed:** Shows "Already Installed" message
3. **If not available:** Shows browser-specific installation instructions

## Testing the Install Button

### On Chrome/Edge Desktop:
1. Visit: https://myzentry.vercel.app
2. Wait 30 seconds (browser checks criteria)
3. Look for install icon in address bar: ⊕ or ⤓
4. OR click "Install App" button

### On Chrome/Edge Mobile:
1. Visit: https://myzentry.vercel.app
2. Look for "Add to Home screen" banner at bottom
3. OR tap ⋮ menu → "Add to Home screen"
4. OR click "Install App" button

### On Safari (iOS):
1. Visit: https://myzentry.vercel.app
2. Tap Share button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down → "Add to Home Screen"
4. **Note:** Our button will show instructions

### On Firefox:
1. Check if PWA support is enabled
2. Desktop may not support installation
3. Mobile: Check browser settings

## Verify PWA Installability

### Chrome DevTools Method:
1. Open your site: https://myzentry.vercel.app
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Go to **Application** tab
4. Click **Manifest** section (left sidebar)
5. Check for errors or warnings
6. Click **Service Workers** section
7. Verify service worker is active

### Lighthouse Audit:
1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Go to **Lighthouse** tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App" only
4. Click "Analyze page load"
5. Check the PWA score and issues

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "beforeinstallprompt event not firing"

**Causes:**
- App already installed
- Using Safari (doesn't support this event)
- Not meeting PWA criteria
- Browser hasn't determined installability yet

**Fix:**
- Wait 30 seconds after page load
- Check if already installed
- Verify manifest.json loads (no 401 error)
- Check service worker is registered

### Issue 2: "Install button does nothing"

**Causes:**
- Browser doesn't support PWA installation
- Missing manifest or service worker
- 401 error blocking manifest.json

**Fix:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify manifest.json loads: https://myzentry.vercel.app/manifest.json
- Verify service worker: DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Disable Vercel Deployment Protection (see VERCEL_401_FIX.md)

### Issue 3: "App installs but doesn't work offline"

**Causes:**
- Service worker not caching properly
- Service worker not activated

**Fix:**
- Check service worker status in DevTools
- Click "Update" or "Unregister" and reload
- Clear cache and reinstall

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Console for Errors
```javascript
// Press F12, then check Console for:
- "Failed to load manifest.json" → 401 error, see VERCEL_401_FIX.md
- "Service Worker registration failed" → Check sw.js file
- Any other errors
```

### 2. Check if Install Event Fires
```javascript
// Open Console and run:
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  console.log('✅ Install prompt available!', e);
});

// If you see this message, the button should work
// If not, your browser doesn't support it or criteria not met
```

### 3. Check if Already Installed
```javascript
// Open Console and run:
if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
  console.log('✅ App is already installed!');
} else {
  console.log('❌ App is not installed');
}
```

### 4. Verify Manifest
Visit directly: https://myzentry.vercel.app/manifest.json
- Should load without 401 error
- Should show proper JSON

### 5. Verify Service Worker
Visit DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Should show "activated and is running"
- If not, check for errors

## Manual Installation (Fallback)

If the button doesn't work, users can still install manually:

### Chrome/Edge:
1. Click ⋮ or ⋯ (top right)
2. Click "Install Zentry" or "Apps" → "Install Zentry"

### Mobile Chrome/Edge:
1. Tap ⋮ menu
2. Tap "Add to Home screen"
3. Confirm

### Safari iOS:
1. Tap Share button (square with arrow)
2. Scroll down
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Confirm
