# üîß Supabase Project Restore Guide

## The Problem
You're seeing **"Signup failed - Failed to fetch"** because your Supabase project is paused or offline.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Your Project Dashboard
**Click this link:** [https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vnixcafcspbqhuytciog](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vnixcafcspbqhuytciog)

### Step 2: Check Project Status
Look at the top of the page:

#### If You See a Yellow/Orange Banner:
- Banner text: "This project is paused" or "Project paused due to inactivity"
- **Action:** Click the **[Restore project]** or **[Resume]** button
- **Wait:** 1-2 minutes for the project to wake up
- **Verify:** Refresh the page and check for green "Active" status

#### If No Banner (Project Appears Active):
Test the connection in your browser:

1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Click **Console** tab
3. Paste this code and press Enter:

```javascript
fetch('https://vnixcafcspbqhuytciog.supabase.co/auth/v1/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('‚úÖ CONNECTED:', d))
  .catch(e => console.log('‚ùå FAILED:', e))
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ **CONNECTED** = Shows health data ‚Üí Project is working!

1. Go back to your app
2. Click **"Create Account"**
3. Fill in username and password

Free tier Supabase projects automatically pause after:
- **7 days** of no activity
- **1 week** without database queries

This is **normal** and not a problem! Just restore the project whenever you need it.
