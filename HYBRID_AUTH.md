# 🔐 Hybrid Authentication System

## Overview

Your app now supports **TWO authentication methods**:

### 1. 📧 **Email/Password (Supabase Auth)**
- Full user account with email
- Secure password authentication
- Password recovery via email
- Data tied to user account (never lost!)

### 2. ⚡ **Quick PIN Login**
- Fast local PIN access
- Can be used alongside email account
- Perfect for quick access on trusted devices
- PIN stored locally only

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **New Users:**
Choose one or use both!

#### Option A: Email/Password Signup
1. Go to Auth page → **Email** tab
2. Enter email & password
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Verify email (check inbox)
5. Optionally set up a quick PIN later

#### Option B: PIN-Only (Quick Start)
1. Go to Auth page → **Quick PIN** tab
2. Create a 4-8 digit PIN
3. Start using immediately
4. Can link to email account later

---

## ✨ Key Features

### **Hybrid Benefits:**
- ✅ Start with PIN (no email needed)
- ✅ Upgrade to email account anytime
- ✅ Use PIN for quick access on trusted devices
- ✅ Email account = data recovery
- ✅ Sync across devices with email login

### **Security:**
- 🔒 Supabase Auth JWT tokens
- 🔒 Encrypted transmission (HTTPS)
- 🔒 Row Level Security (RLS)
- 🔒 PIN never leaves device
- 🔒 Password reset via email

---

## 🔄 Data Migration

### **PIN → Email Account**
Your existing PIN-based data is preserved!

When you create an email account:
1. Your PIN data stays in localStorage
2. New data saves to your email account
3. Both work seamlessly together

### **Linking PIN to Account**
Future feature: Link existing PIN data to email account

---

## 📱 Usage Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Personal Device**
- Use quick PIN for daily access
- Have email account for backup/recovery

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Devices**
- Sign in with email on all devices
- Set up device-specific PINs for quick access

### **Scenario 3: Shared Device**
- Use email login only (more secure)
- Don't set up PIN on shared devices

---

## 🔑 User ID System

### **How Data is Associated:**

#### With Email Account:
```
User ID = Supabase Auth User ID (UUID)
Example: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

#### With PIN Only:
```
User ID = Hashed PIN
Example: user_MTIzNA==
```

### **Priority:**
1. Check for Supabase Auth session → Use Auth User ID
2. No session? → Fall back to PIN-based ID

---

## 📊 Database Schema

No changes needed! The existing schema works with both:
- Email users get real UUID user_id
- PIN users get hashed PIN as user_id

---

## 🎨 UI Features

### **Auth Page Tabs:**
- **Quick PIN** tab - For PIN login/setup
- **Email** tab - For email signup/login

### **Visual Indicators:**
- 🟢 Green cloud = Logged in with email (cloud synced)
- 🟡 Amber cloud = PIN-only mode (local + cloud)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### **Supabase Settings:**
Already configured! The email auth uses:
- Email confirmation enabled
- Password recovery emails
- Secure session management

### **Environment Variables:**
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
```
