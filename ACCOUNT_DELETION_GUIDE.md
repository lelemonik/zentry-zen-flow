# 🗑️ Account Deletion Feature - Complete Guide

## ✅ What's Implemented

A fully functional account deletion feature that replaces the logout button with a comprehensive account deletion system.

## 🎯 Features

### 1. **Danger Zone UI** ⚠️
- Replaced "Log Out" button with "Delete Account Permanently"
- Red/destructive styling to indicate serious action
- Warning box with clear consequences listed
- Located in Settings → Preferences → Danger Zone

### 2. **Confirmation Dialog** 🛡️
- Double confirmation required
- User must type "DELETE" to proceed
- Clear explanation of what will be deleted
- Cancel button to abort

### 3. **Complete Data Deletion** 🔥
Deletes:
- ✅ All tasks
- ✅ All notes
- ✅ All schedule events
- ✅ User profile
- ✅ Authentication account (via SQL function)
- ✅ PIN and local storage data
- ✅ Session data

### 4. **Smart Fallback** 🔄
- If Supabase SQL function isn't set up: Deletes data + signs out
- If user is PIN-only (no Supabase account): Clears localStorage
- Always clears local data regardless of server response
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: SQL Function Setup (REQUIRED for full deletion)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Open the file: `supabase-delete-user-function.sql`
4. Copy all contents
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter

This creates a secure function that allows users to delete their own account.

### Step 2: Test the Feature

1. **Create a test account:**
   ```
   Username: testdelete
   Password: test1234
   ```

2. **Add some data:**
   - Create a task
   - Write a note
   - Add schedule event

3. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click Settings in sidebar
   - Go to Preferences tab
   - Scroll to bottom "Danger Zone"

4. **Test deletion:**
   - Click "Delete Account Permanently"
   - Read the warning dialog
   - Type "DELETE" in the confirmation box
   - Click "Delete Account Forever"

5. **Verify:**
   - Should redirect to login page
   - Try logging in with old credentials → Should fail
   - Check Supabase dashboard → User should be gone

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/lib/supabaseAuth.ts**
   - Added `deleteAccount()` function
   - Handles both Supabase and PIN-only users
   - Uses SQL RPC function `delete_user()`
   - Falls back to manual deletion if RPC fails

   - SQL function for secure account deletion
   - Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS

   - Only accessible by authenticated users

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required:**
   - Only logged-in users can delete their account
   - SQL function verifies `auth.uid()`

2. **Double Confirmation:**
   - Visual warning box
   - Confirmation dialog
   - Must type "DELETE" exactly

3. **RLS Compliance:**
   - SQL function respects Row Level Security
   - Users can only delete their own data

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Scenario 1: SQL Function Not Set Up
**Error Message:** 
```
"Account data deleted. Auth user deletion requires the SQL function. 
Please run supabase-delete-user-function.sql in your Supabase SQL Editor."
```
**Result:** Data deleted, user signed out, but auth user remains in Supabase

### Scenario 2: Network Error
**Error Message:**
```
"Could not delete account. Please try again."
```
**Result:** Local data still cleared, user can try again or contact support

### Scenario 3: PIN-Only User
**Result:** Simply clears localStorage, no server calls needed
